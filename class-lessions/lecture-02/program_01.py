# Question: Write a program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers.

# Show message to the screen for getting two input numbers.
number1 = int(input('Enter first number: '))
number2 = int(input('Enter second number: '))

# Calculate this two number into addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
# and assign separate variables.
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2
division = number1 / number2

# Show the output in the separate lines.
print("The addition is : ", addition)
print("The subtraction is : ", subtraction)
print("The multiplication is : ", multiplication)
print("The division is : ", division)
